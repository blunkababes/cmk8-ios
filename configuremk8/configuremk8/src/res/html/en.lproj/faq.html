<div class="question"> What do all of the attributes mean? </div>

<br>
<div class="attribute"> Acceleration </div>
The rate that it takes for a vehicle to reach its top speed. If you find yourself crashing or going off road a lot, then this attribute might be important for you.
<br>

<br>
<div class="attribute"> Average Speed </div>
The averaged top speed of the vehicle. Does not affect off-road travel. The average speed is equally weighted from the following 4 attributes:
<ul>
  <li><span class="attribute">Ground Speed:</span> The top speed of the vehicle on land with normal gravity.</li>
  <li><span class="attribute">Anti-Gravity Speed:</span> The top speed of the vehicle in anti-gravity mode</li>
  <li><span class="attribute">Air Speed:</span> The top speed of the vehicle while gliding.</li>
  <li><span class="attribute">Water Speed:</span> The top speed of the vehicle while driving underwater.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div class="attribute">Average Handling</div>
The averaged turning ability of the vehicle. The higher the stat, the sharper the vehicle can turn. The average handling is equally weighted from the following 4 attributes:
<ul>
  <li><span class="attribute">Ground Handling:</span> The turning ability of the vehicle on land with normal gravity.</li>
  <li><span class="attribute">Anti-Gravity Handling:</span> The turning ability of the vehicle in anti-gravity mode</li>
  <li><span class="attribute">Air Handling:</span> The turning ability of the vehicle while gliding.</li>
  <li><span class="attribute">Water Handling:</span> The turning ability of the vehicle while driving underwater.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div class="attribute">Miniturbo</div>
The strength of the vehicle's miniturbo speed boosts.
<br>

<br>
<div class="attribute">Traction</div>
The grasp of the vehicle. Vehicles with higher traction slip less on certain terrain and can stabilize on the road better.
<br>

<br>
<div class="attribute">Weight</div>
The weight of the vehicle. Vehicles with higher weight knock away vehicles with lower weight.
<br>

<br>
<div class="question">A Note About Acceleration</div>
<br>
Although the acceleration stats can have decimal values, when actually applied they are rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, a configuration with acceleration of 4.25 has the same acceleration as a configuration with an acceleration of 4.75. They are both rounded to 4. The calculator for creating custom configurations takes this into account when scoring each combination. However, the rounded value is not shown to the user when viewing stats.
<br>

<br>
<div class="question">How are the custom configurations calculated?</div>
<br>
The custom configurations are calculated by taking a weighted average of the following 6 attributes: Acceleration, Average Speed, Average Handling, Miniturbo, Traction, and Weight. Each attribute has an equal influence on the total score. Note: It may be hard to come up with a variety of configurations since the game does not seem to favor the more balanced characters.
<br>

<br>
<div class="question">Stats Not Shown</div>

<br>
<div class="attribute">Body frame sizes</div>
The size of the frame can influence how large a target the vehicle is for things like shells and being hit by other players.  The 3 sizes available are influenced only by character group (weight class):
<ul>
  <li><span class="attribute">Small:</span> Flyweights and Featherweights</li>
  <li><span class="attribute">Medium:</span> Lightweights and Middleweights</li>
  <li><span class="attribute">Large:</span> Cruiserweights, Metalweights, Heavyweights</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div class="attribute">Drift</div>
This affects how the vehicle slides when power sliding. There are 2 types: outward drift and inward drift. Outward drift forces the vehicle to slide outwards, more like a real drift. Inward drift allows the vehicle to take sharp turns while drifting. All vehicles have outward drift, except for Vehicle Group F which contains the 4 bikes: Comet, Sport Bike, Jet Bike, and Yoshi Bike. These bikes have inward drift.
<br>

<br>
<div class="question">What about My Mii?</div>
<br>
The Mii will take 1 of the 3 character groups (weight classes), depending on the Mii&#39;s size that you configured in the Mii Maker.
<ul>
  <li><span class="attribute">Small -&gt;</span> Flyweight</li>
  <li><span class="attribute">Medium -&gt;</span> Middleweight</li>
  <li><span class="attribute">Large -&gt;</span> Heavyweight</li>
</ul>

<br>
<div class="question">Where does all of the data come from?</div>
<br>
All stats come from <a href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_8">http://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_8</a>.

<div class="question">I like this app. How can I say thanks?</div>
<br>
Leaving good feedback in the App Store is a great way to say thanks.
